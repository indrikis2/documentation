Using the Scene View
====================


The <span class=keyword>Scene View</span> is your interactive sandbox. You will use the Scene View to select and position environments, the player, the camera, enemies, and all other <span class=keyword>GameObjects</span>. Maneuvering and manipulating objects within the Scene View are some of the most important functions in Unity, so it's important to be able to do them quickly.
