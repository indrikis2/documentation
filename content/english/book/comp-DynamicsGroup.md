Component Details
-----------------


###Physics Control
* [Rigidbody](class-Rigidbody.md) - Rigidbodies put objects under physics control.
* [Constant Force](class-ConstantForce.md) - A utility component that adds a constant force to a rigidbody. Great for rockets and other quick functionality.

###Colliders
* [Sphere Collider](class-SphereCollider.md) - use for sphere-shaped objects.
* [Box Collider](class-BoxCollider.md) - use for box-shaped objects.
* [Capsule Collider](class-CapsuleCollider.md) - use for capsule-like (a cylinder with hemisphere ends) objects.
* [Mesh Collider](class-MeshCollider.md) - takes the graphical [mesh](class-Mesh.md) and uses it as a collision shape.
* [Physic Material](class-PhysicMaterial.md) - contains settings allowing you to fine-tune your object's physical properties (friction, bounce, etc).

###Joints
* [Hinge Joint](class-HingeJoint.md) - Used to make door hinges.
* [Spring Joint](class-SpringJoint.md) - A spring-like joint.
* [Fixed Joint](class-FixedJoint.md) - Use to "lock" objects together.
* [Configurable Joint](class-ConfigurableJoint.md) - Use create complex joint behaviors of virtually any kind

###Special Function
* [Character Controller](class-CharacterController.md) and [Character Joint](class-CharacterJoint.md) - Used to make character controllers.
* [Wheel Collider](class-WheelCollider.md) - A special collider for grounded vehicles.
* [Skinned Cloth](class-SkinnedCloth.md) - Used to create Skinned cloth
* [Interactive Cloth](class-InteractiveCloth.md) - Used to create Interactive cloths, this is just normal cloth being simulated.
