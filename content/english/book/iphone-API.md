iOS Scripting
=============


Unity iOS provides a number of new scripting APIs to access unique device functionality. For cross-platform projects, UNITY_IPHONE is defined for conditionally compiling iOS-specific C# code. The following new scripting classes were introduced:

|    |
|:---|
|[iPhoneInput](ScriptRef:iPhoneInput.html) |Access to multi-touch screen, accelerometer, device orientation and geographical location.
|[iPhoneSettings](ScriptRef:iPhoneSettings.html) |iOS specific settings, such as screen orientation, dimming and information about device hardware.
|[iPhoneKeyboard](ScriptRef:iPhoneKeyboard.html) |Support for native on-screen keyboard.
|[iPhoneUtils](ScriptRef:iPhoneUtils.html) |Useful functions for movie playback, anti-piracy protection and vibration.
