Tutorials
=========


These tutorials will let you work with Unity while you follow along.  They will give you hands-on experience with building real projects.  For new users, it is recommended that you follow the GUI Essentials and Scripting Essentials tutorials first.  After that, you can follow any of them.  They are all in PDF format, so you can print them out and follow along or read them alongside Unity.

__Note:__ These Tutorials are intended for use with the Desktop version of Unity, these will not work with Android or iOS devices (iPhone/iPad).
