Microphone
==========


The <span class=keyword>Microphone</span> class is useful for capturing input from a built-in (_physical_) microphone on your PC or mobile device.

With this class, you can start and end a recording from a built-in microphone, get a listing of available audio input devices (microphones), and find out the status of each such input device. 

For more information on how to use this class, see the Scripting Reference.
