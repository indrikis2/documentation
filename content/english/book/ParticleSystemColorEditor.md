Colors and Gradients in the Particle System (Shuriken)
======================================================



![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/ShurikenColorProperty.png)  
For properties that deal with color, the <span class=component>Particle System</span> makes use of the <span class=keyword>Color and Gradient Editor</span>. 
It works in a similar way to the [Curve Editor](ParticleSystemCurveEditor.md).

The color-based properties will have a pull down menu on the right hand side, where you can choose between:

<span class=component>Color</span>: The color will be the same throughout time (see [Color Picker](EditingValueProperties.md))

<span class=component>Gradient</span>: The gradient (RGBA) will vary throughout time, edited in the [Gradient Editor](GradientEditor.md)

<span class=component>Random Between Two Colors</span>: The color varies with time and is chosen at random between two values specified in the [Color Picker](EditingValueProperties.md)

<span class=component>Random Between Two Gradients</span>: The gradient (RGBA) varies with time and is chosen at random between two values specified [Gradient Editor](GradientEditor.md)
