|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Version Control</span>|Which version control system should be used.|
|<span class=component>WWW Security Emulation</span>|For webplayer testing, the editor can "pretend" that the game is a webplayer hosted at this URL.|
|<span class=component>Asset Serialization</span>|To assist with version control merges, Unity can store scene files in a textual format (see the [textual scene format](TextualSceneFormat.md) pages for further details). If merges will not be performed then Unity can store scenes in a more space efficient binary format or allow both text and binary scene files to exist at the same time.|
