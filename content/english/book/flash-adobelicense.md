Flash: Adobe Premium Features License
=====================================


What is the license and why is it needed?
-----------------------------------------


When publishing your Unity project to Flash, you will need to acquire a license from Adobe in order for the content to work in the Flash Player. The Adobe [documentation of premium features](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/premium-features.html.md) explains why a license is required for Unity built Flash games:

````

"Premium Features includes the XC APIs Â (domain memory APIs in combination with Stage3D hardware acceleration APIs), which allows C/C++ developers and other developers using 3rd party tools, including Unity, to target Flash Player for the distribution of their games."

````

For more information and the latest details on the license, please refer to the [Adobe article which explains this in detail](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/premium-features.html.md).
