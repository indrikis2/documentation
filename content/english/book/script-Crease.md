Crease
======


The <span class=keyword>Crease</span> is a common non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering technique that enhances the visibility of objects by adding outlines of variable thickness.

As with the other [image effects](comp-ImageEffects.md), this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [Pro Standard Assets](HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets.md) installed before it becomes available.
