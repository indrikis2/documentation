GUI Layer
=========


A <span class=keyword>GUI Layer</span> Component is attached to a Camera to enable rendering of 2D GUIs.

When a GUI Layer is attached to a Camera it will render all [GUI Textures](class-GuiTexture.md) and [GUI Texts](class-GuiText.md) in the scene.  GUI Layers do not affect [UnityGUI](GUIScriptingGuide.md) in any way.

You can enable and disable rendering GUI in a single camera by clicking on the check box of the GUI Layer in the <span class=keyword>Inspector</span>.
