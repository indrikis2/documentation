__What is the new Activation system?__

With our new Licensing System, we allow you, the user, to manage your Unity license independently. Contacting the Support Team when you need to switch machine is a thing of the past! The system allows instant, automated migration of your machine, with a single click. Please read our “Managing your Unity 4.0 License” link for more information.

FAQ
===


__How many machines can I install my copy of Unity on?__

Every paid commercial Unity license allows a *single* person to use Unity on *two* machines that they have exclusive use of. Be it a Mac and a PC or your Home and Work machines.
Educational licenses sold via Unity or any one of our resellers are only good for a single activation. The same goes for Trial licenses, unless otherwise stated.

The free version of Unity may not be licensed by a commercial entity with annual gross revenues (based on fiscal year) in excess of US$100,000, or by an educational, non-profit or government entity with an annual budget of over US$100,000.

If you are a Legal Entity, you may not combine files developed with the free version of Unity with any files developed by you (or by any third party) through the use of Unity Pro.
Please see our EULA "*EULA LINK*" for further information regarding license usage.

  
__I need to use my license on another machine, but I get that message that my license has been “Activated too many times”. What should I do?__

You’ll need to “Return” your license. This enables you to return the license on the machine you no longer require, which in turn enables you to reactivate on a new machine. Please refer to the *MANAGING YOUR UNITY 4.0 LICENSES* link at the top of the page, for more information.

  
__My account credentials aren’t recognised when logging in during the Activation process?__

Please ensure that your details are being entered correctly. Passwords ARE case sensitive, so ensure you’re typing exactly as you registered. You can reset your password using the link below:

If you’re still having issues logging in, please contact ""support@unity3d.com""

  
__Can I use Unity 4.x with my 3.x Serial number?__

No, you can’t. In order to use Unity 4.x, you’ll need to upgrade to a 4.x license. You can do this Online, via our Web Store. https://store.unity3d.com/shop/

  
__I’m planning on replacing an item of hardware and/or my OS. What should I do?__

As with changing machine, you’ll need to “Return” your license before making any hardware or OS changes to your machine. If you fail to “Return” the license, our server will see a request from another machine and inform you that you’ve reached your activation limit for the license. Please refer to the *MANAGING YOUR UNITY 4.0 LICENSES* link at the top of the page, for more information regarding the return of a license.

  
__My machine died without me being able to “Return” my license, what now?__

Please email ""support@unity3d.com"" explaining your situation, including the details below.
 - The Serial number you were using on the machine.
 - The (local network) name of the machine that died

The Support Team will then be able to “Return” your license manually.

  
__I have two licenses, each with an add-on I require, how do I activate them in unison on my machine?__

You can’t, unfortunately! A single license may only be used on one machine at any one time.

  
__Where is my Unity 4.x license file stored?__

- /Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_v4.x.ulf (OS X)

- C:\ProgramData\Unity (Windows)
