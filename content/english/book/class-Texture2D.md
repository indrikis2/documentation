Texture 2D
==========


<span class=keyword>Textures</span> bring your <span class=keyword>Meshes</span>, <span class=keyword>Particles</span>, and interfaces to life! They are image or movie files that you lay over or wrap around your objects. As they are so important, they have a lot of properties. If you are reading this for the first time, jump down to [Details](#details), and return to the actual settings when you need a reference.


The shaders you use for your objects put specific requirements on which textures you need, but the basic principle is that you can put any image file inside your project. If it meets the size requirements (specified below), it will get imported and optimized for game use.  This extends to multi-layer Photoshop or TIFF files - they are flattened on import, so there is no size penalty for your game.


Properties
----------


The <span class=keyword>Texture Inspector</span> looks a bit different from most others:   

![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/TexImporterFull40.png)  

The inspector is split into two sections, the <span class=keyword>Texture Importer</span> and the texture preview.

Texture Importer
----------------


Textures all come from image files in your <span class=keyword>Project Folder</span>. How they are imported is specified by the <span class=keyword>Texture Importer</span>. You change these by selecting the file texture in the <span class=keyword>Project View</span> and modifying the <span class=keyword>Texture Importer</span> in the <span class=keyword>Inspector</span>.

The topmost item in the inspector is the <span class=menu>Texture Type</span> menu that allows you to select the type of texture you want to create from the source image file.


|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Texture Type</span> |Select this to set basic parameters depending on the purpose of your texture. |
|>>><span class=component>Texture</span> |This is the most common setting used for all the textures in general. |
|>>><span class=component>Normal Map</span> |Select this to turn the color channels into a format suitable for real-time normal mapping. For more info, see [Normal Maps](#normalmaps) |
|>>><span class=component>GUI</span> |Use this if your texture is going to be used on any HUD/GUI Controls. |
|>>><span class=component>Reflection</span> |Also known as Cube Maps, used to create reflections on textures. check [Cubemap Textures](class-Cubemap.md) for more info.|
|>>><span class=component>Cookie</span> |This sets up your texture with the basic parameters used for the Cookies of your lights|
|>>><span class=component>Advanced</span> |Select this when you want to have specific parameters on your texture and you want to have total control over your texture. |

An interesting way to add a lot of visual detail to your scenes is to use <span class=keyword>Cookies</span> - greyscale textures you use to control the precise look of in-game lighting. This is fantastic for making moving clouds and giving an impression of dense foliage. The [Light](class-Light.md) page has more info on all this, but the main thing is that for textures to be usable for cookies you just need to set the <span class=menu>Texture Type</span> to Cookie.

|<span class=component>Non Power of 2</span> |If texture has non-power-of-two size, this will define a scaling behavior at import time (for more info see the [Texture Sizes](#texturesizes) section below):|
|>>><span class=component>None</span> |Texture will be padded to the next larger power-of-two size for use with GUITexture component. |
|>>><span class=component>To nearest</span> |Texture will be scaled to the nearest power-of-two size at import time. For instance 257x511 texture will become 256x512. Note that PVRTC formats require textures to be square (width equal to height), therefore final size will be upscaled to 512x512. |
|>>><span class=component>To larger</span> |Texture will be scaled to the next larger power-of-two size at import time. For instance 257x511 texture will become 512x512. |

|>>><span class=component>CrossHorizontal</span> |The texture contains the six faces of the cube arranged in a horizontally oriented cross. |
|<span class=component>Read/Write Enabled</span> |Select this to enable access to the texture data from scripts (GetPixels, SetPixels and other [Texture2D](ScriptRef:Texture2D.html) functions). Note however that a copy of the texture data will be made, doubling the amount of memory required for texture asset. Use only if absolutely necessary. This is only valid for uncompressed and DTX compressed textures, other types of compressed textures cannot be read from. Disabled by default. |
|<span class=component>Import Type</span> |The way the image data is interpreted. |
|>>><span class=component>Default</span> |Standard texture. |

|<span class=component>Create from grayscale</span> |(Normal map mode only) Creates the map from the luminance information in the image |
|<span class=component>Bypass sRGB sampling</span> |(Default mode only) Use the exact colour values from the image rather than compensating for gamma (useful when the texture is for GUI or used as a way to encode non-image data) |
|<span class=component>Generate Mip Maps</span> |Select this to enable mip-map generation. Mip maps are smaller versions of the texture that get used when the texture is very small on screen. For more info, see [Mip Maps](#mipmaps) below. |
|<span class=component>In Linear Space</span> |Generate mipmaps in linear colour space. |
|<span class=component>Border Mip Maps</span> |Select this to avoid colors seeping out to the edge of the lower Mip levels. Used for light cookies (see below). |
|<span class=component>Mip Map Filtering</span> |Two ways of mip map filtering are available to optimize image quality: |
|>>><span class=component>Box</span> |The simplest way to fade out the mipmaps - the mip levels become smoother and smoother as they go down in size. |
|>>><span class=component>Kaiser</span> |A sharpening Kaiser algorithm is run on the mip maps as they go down in size. If your textures are too blurry in the distance, try this option. |
|<span class=component>Fade Out Mipmaps</span> |Enable this to make the mipmaps fade to gray as the mip levels progress. This is used for detail maps. The left most scroll is the first mip level to begin fading out at. The rightmost scroll defines the mip level where the texture is completely grayed out|

Per-Platform Overrides
----------------------


When you are building for different platforms, you have to think about the resolution of your textures for the target platform, the size and the quality. You can set default options and then override the defaults for a specific platform.


![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/TextureImporterOverride.png)  
_Default settings for all platforms._

|    |    |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Max Texture Size</span> |The maximum imported texture size. Artists often prefer to work with huge textures - scale the texture down to a suitable size with this. |
|<span class=component>Texture Format</span> |What internal representation is used for the texture. This is a tradeoff between size and quality. In the examples below we show the final size of a in-game texture of 256 by 256 pixels:|
|>>><span class=component>Compressed</span> |Compressed RGB texture. This is the most common format for diffuse textures. 4 bits per pixel (32 KB for a 256x256 texture). |
|>>><span class=component>16 bit</span> |Low-quality truecolor. Has 16 levels of red, green, blue and alpha. |
|>>><span class=component>Truecolor</span> |Truecolor, this is the highest quality. At 256 KB for a 256x256 texture. |

If you have set the <span class=menu>Texture Type</span> to <span class=menu>Advanced</span> then the <span class=menu>Texture Format</span> has different values.

Unless you're targeting a specific hardware, like Tegra, we'd recommend using ETC1 compression. If needed you could store an external alpha channel and still benefit from lower texture footprint.
If you absolutely want to store an alpha channel in a texture, RGBA16 bit is the compression supported by all hardware vendors.

Textures can be imported from DDS files but only DXT or uncompressed pixel formats are currently supported. 

If your app utilizes an unsupported texture compression, the textures will be uncompressed to RGBA 32 and stored in memory along with the compressed ones.
So in this case you lose time decompressing textures and lose memory storing them twice. It may also have a very negative impact on rendering performance.

###Supported Formats
Unity can read the following file formats: PSD, TIFF, JPG, TGA, PNG, GIF, BMP, IFF, PICT. It should be noted that Unity can import multi-layer PSD & TIFF files just fine. They are flattened automatically on import but the layers are maintained in the assets themselves, so you don't lose any of your work when using these file types natively. This is important as it allows you to just have one copy of your textures that you can use from Photoshop, through your 3D modelling app and into Unity.


<a id="texturesizes"></a>
###Texture Sizes

Ideally texture sizes should be powers of two on the sides. These sizes are as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 pixels. The textures do not have to be square, i.e. width can be different from height.

It is possible to use other (non power of two) texture sizes with Unity. Non power of two texture sizes work best when used on [GUI Textures](class-GuiTexture.md), however if used on anything else they will be converted to an uncompressed RGBA 32 bit format. That means they will take up more video memory (compared to PVRT(iOS)/DXT(Desktop) compressed textures), will be slower to load and slower to render (if you are on iOS mode). In general you'll use non power of two sizes only for GUI purposes.

Non power of two texture assets can be scaled up at import time using the <span class=component>Non Power of 2</span> option in the advanced texture type in the import settings. Unity will scale texture contents as requested, and in the game they will behave just like any other texture, so they can still be compressed and very fast to load.  

One potential problem with using non power of two textures this is that Unity will convert these textures internally to power of two, and this stretching process can introduce minor visual artefacts.  

###UV Mapping

When mapping a 2D texture onto a 3D model, some sort of wrapping is done. This is called <span class=keyword>UV mapping</span> and is done in your 3D modelling app. Inside Unity, you can scale and move the texture using [Materials](class-Material.md). Scaling normal & detail maps is especially useful.

Mip Maps are a list of progressively smaller versions of an image, used to optimise performance on real-time 3D engines. Objects that are far away from the camera use the smaller texture versions. Using mip maps uses 33% more memory, but not using them can be a huge performance loss. You should always use mipmaps for in-game textures; the only exceptions are textures that will never be minified (e.g. GUI textures).

###Normal Maps

Normal maps are used by normal map shaders to make low-polygon models look as if they contain more detail. Unity uses normal maps encoded as RGB images. You also have the option to generate a normal map from a grayscale height map image.


###Detail Maps

If you want to make a terrain, you normally use your main texture to show where there are areas of grass, rocks sand, etc... If your terrain has a decent size, it will end up very blurry. [Detail textures](HOWTO-UseDetailTexture.md) hide this fact by fading in small details as your main texture gets up close.

When drawing detail textures, a neutral gray is invisible, white makes the main texture twice as bright and black makes the main texture completely black.


###Reflections (Cube Maps)

If you want to use texture for reflection maps (e.g. use the <span class=component>Reflective</span> builtin shaders), you need to use [Cubemap Textures](class-Cubemap.md).

###Anisotropic filtering

Anisotropic filtering increases texture quality when viewed from a grazing angle, at some expense of rendering cost (the cost is entirely on the graphics card). Increasing anisotropy level is usually a good idea for ground and floor textures. In [Quality Settings](class-QualitySettings.md) anisotropic filtering can be forced for all textures or disabled completely.
