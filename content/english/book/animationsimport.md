Importing Animations
====================


First of all we have to import the character.  Unity natively imports Maya (.mb or .ma) files, Cinema 4D (.c4d) files, and fbx files which can be exported from most animation packages. Click here to learn how to [export from your modelling/animation package](HOWTO-importObject).
To import the animations you simply place the model in the <span class=keyword>Assets</span> folder of your project. Unity will now automatically import it. Highlight it in the <span class=inspector>Project View</span> and edit the <span class=menu>Import Settings</span> in the inspector.
