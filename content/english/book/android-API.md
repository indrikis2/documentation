Android Scripting
=================


Unity Android provides a number of scripting APIs unified with iOS APIs to access handheld device functionality. For cross-platform projects, UNITY_ANDROID is defined for conditionally compiling Android-specific C# code. The following scripting classes contain Android-related changes (some of the API is shared between Android and iOS):

|    |
|:---|
|[Input](ScriptRef:Input.html) |Access to multi-touch screen, accelerometer and device orientation.
|[iPhoneSettings](ScriptRef:iPhoneSettings.html) |Some of the Android settings, such as screen orientation, dimming and information about device hardware.
|[iPhoneKeyboard](ScriptRef:iPhoneKeyboard.html) |Support for native on-screen keyboard.
|[iPhoneUtils](ScriptRef:iPhoneUtils.html) |Useful functions for movie playback, anti-piracy protection and vibration.
