==============


<span class=keyword>UnityGUI</span> is the GUI creation system built into Unity.  It consists of creating different <span class=keyword>Controls</span>, and defining the content and appearance of those controls.

The <span class=keyword>Components</span> of UnityGUI allow you to define the appearance of Controls.
