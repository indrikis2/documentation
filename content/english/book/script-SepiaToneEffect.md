Sepia Tone image effect
=======================


<span class=keyword>Sepia Tone</span> is a simple image effect that tints an image to resemble an old photograph.

As with the other [image effects](comp-ImageEffects.md), this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [Pro Standard Assets](HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets.md) installed before it becomes available.
