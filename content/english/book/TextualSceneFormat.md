Textual Scene File Format (Pro-only Feature)
============================================


As well as the default binary format, Unity also provides a textual format for scene data. This can be useful when working with version control software, since textual files generated separately can be merged more easily than binary files. Also, the text data can be generated and parsed by tools, making it possible to create and analyze scenes automatically. The pages in this section provide some reference material for working with the format.
