Collision Module
----------------


![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/ShurikenCollisionModule40.png)  
Set up collisions for the particles of this Particle System. World and planar collisions are supported. Planar collision is very efficient for simple collision detection. Planes are set up by referencing an existing transform in the scene or by creating a new empty GameObject for this purpose. Another benefit of planar collision is that particle systems with collision planes can be set up as prefabs. World collision uses raycasts so must be used with care in order to ensure good performance. However, for cases where approximate collisions are acceptable world collision in <span class=component>Low</span> or <span class=component>Medium</span> quality can be very efficient.

###Properties common for any Collision Module

|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Planes/World</span>          |Specify the collision type: <span class=component>Planes</span> for planar collision or <span class=component>World</span> for world collisions.|
|<span class=component>Dampen</span>                |(0-1) When the particle collides, it will keep this fraction of its speed. Unless it is set to 1.0, the particle will become slower after collision.|
|<span class=component>Bounce</span>                |(0-1) When the particle collides, it will keep this fraction of the component of the velocity, which is normal to the plane of collision.|
|<span class=component>Lifetime Loss</span>         |(0-1) The fraction of Start Lifetime lost on each collision. When lifetime reaches 0, the particle dies. For example if a particle should die on first collision, set this to 1.0.|
|<span class=component>Min Kill Speed</span>        |The minimum speed of a particle before it is killed.|

###Properties available only in the <span class=component>Planes</span> Mode

|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Planes</span> |Planes are defined by assigning a reference to a transform. This transform can be any transform in the scene and can be animated. Multiple planes can be used. Note: the Y-axis is used as the normal of a plane.|
|<span class=component>Visualization</span>    |Only used for visualizing the planes: Grid or Solid.|
|>>><span class=component>Grid</span>           |Rendered as gizmos and is useful for quick indication of position and orientation in the world.|
|>>><span class=component>Solid</span>          |Renders a plane in the scene which is useful for exact positioning of a plane.|

|<span class=component>Collision Quality</span>|The quality of the world collision.|
|>>><span class=component>_High_</span>           |All particles performs a scene raycast per frame. Note: This is CPU intensive, it should only be used with 1000 simultaneous particles (scene wide) or less.|
|>>><span class=component>_Medium_</span>         |The particle system receives a share of the globally set <span class=component>Particle Raycast Budget</span> (see [Particle Raycast Budget](class-QualitySettings.md)) in each frame. Particles are updated in a round-robin fashion where particles that do not receive a raycast in a given frame will lookup and use older collisions stored in a cache. Note: This collision type is approximate and some particles will leak, particularly at corners.|
|>>><span class=component>Low</span>            |Same as <span class=component>Medium</span> except the particle system is only awarded a share of the <span class=component>Particle Raycast Budget</span> every fourth frame.|
|<span class=component>Voxel Size</span>         |Density of the voxels used for caching intersections used in the <span class=component>Medium</span> and <span class=component>Low</span> quality setting. The size of a voxel is given in scene units. Usually, 0.5 - 1.0 should be used (assuming metric units).|

Texture Sheet Animation Module
------------------------------


![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/ShurikenTextureSheetModule.png)  
Animates UV coordinates of the particle over its lifetime. Animation frames can be presented in a form of a grid or every row in the sheet can be separate animation. The frames are animated with curves or can be a random frame between two curves. The speed of the animation is defined by "Cycles".
IMPORTANT: The texture used for animation is the one used by the material found in the Renderer module.

Renderer Module
---------------


![](http://docwiki.hq.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/ShurikenRendererModule40.png)  
The renderer module exposes the <span class=component>ParticleSystemRenderer</span> component's properties. Note that even though a GameObject has a <span class=component>ParticleSystemRenderer</span> component, its properties are only exposed here, when this module is removed/added. It is actually the <span class=component>ParticleSystemRenderer</span> component that is added or removed.


|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|<span class=component>Render Mode</span>             |Select one of the following particle render modes|
|>>><span class=component>Billboard</span>            |Makes the particles always face the camera|
|>>><span class=component>Stretched Billboard</span>            |Particles are stretched using the following parameters|
|>>><span class=component>-  Camera Scale</span>      |How much the camera speed is factored in when determining particle stretching|

|>>><span class=component>-  Mesh</span>              |The reference to the mesh used for rendering particles|
|<span class=component>Normal Direction</span>        |Value from 0 to 1 that determines how much normals point toward the camera (0) and how much sideways toward the centre of the view (1).|
|<span class=component>Material</span>                |Material used by billboarded or mesh particles.|
|<span class=component>Sort Mode</span>               |The draw order of particles can be sorted by distance, youngest first, or oldest first.|
|<span class=component>Sorting Fudge</span>           |Use this to affect the draw order. Particle systems with _lower_ sorting fudge numbers are more likely to be drawn last, and thus appear in front of other transparent objects, including other particles.|
|<span class=component>Cast Shadows</span>            |Should particles cast shadows? May or may not be possible depending on the material|
|<span class=component>Receive Shadows</span>         |Should particles receive shadows? May or may not be possible depending on the material|
