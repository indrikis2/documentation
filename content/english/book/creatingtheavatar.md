Creating the Avatar
===================


When an FBX file is added to the project, it is imported. You then have the option to create an <span class=keyword>Avatar</span>, which is the essential step for activating all Mecanim features for humanoid animation. 

To create an avatar, you click the <span class=menu>Create Avatar</span> checkbox.

When the Avatar has been created, you will have the option to apply it or configure it.

After you hit <span class=menu>Apply</span>, Mecanim will attempt to match up your existing bone structure to the Avatar bone structure. 

When the avatar has been "Applied", an Avatar sub-asset is added to the FBX asset, which you will be able to see in the project view hierarchy.

If Mecanim was unable to create the Avatar, you need to [configure it manually](Configuring the Avatar).
