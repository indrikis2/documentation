User Guide
==========


This section of the Manual is focused on the features and functions of Unity.  It discusses the interface, core Unity building blocks, asset workflow, and basic gameplay creation.  By the time you are done reading the user guide, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Unity to put together an interactive scene and publish it.

We recommend that new users begin by reading the [Unity Basics](UnityBasics.md) section.
