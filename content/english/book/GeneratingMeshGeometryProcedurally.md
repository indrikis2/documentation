Generating Mesh Geometry Procedurally
=====================================


The Mesh class gives script access to an object's mesh geometry, allowing meshes to be created or modified at runtime. This technique is useful for graphical effects (eg, stretching or squashing an object) but can also be useful in level design and optimisation. The following sections explain the basic details of how a mesh is constructed along with an exploration of the API and an example.
