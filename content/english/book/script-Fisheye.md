Fisheye image effect
====================


The <span class=keyword>Fisheye</span> image effect creates distorts the image as if viewed through a fisheye lens (although any lens will distort the image to some extent).

As with the other [image effects](comp-ImageEffects.md), this effect is only available in Unity Pro and you must have the [Pro Standard Assets](HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets.md) installed before it becomes available.

_Fisheye distorts the image at its corners. The use of [image antialiasing techniques](script-AntialiasingAsPostEffect.md) is highly recommended because of sampling artefacts._
