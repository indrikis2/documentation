Project Types
=============


###There are 4 Wii project types which can be built:
* __Disk__
>This is a DVD title. The final game will be on a DVD disc.

* __WiiWare__
>This is a WiiWare title. The final game will be available on Wii Shop Channel.
>__Important:__ The full game package cannot exceed 40 Mb.

* __Disk with Link Step__
>Same as Disk project type except you'll be able to link the final player yourself. That means you can hook any native code to your managed code. This is useful if you want to implement your own specific feature which is missing.

* __WiiWare with Link Step__
>Same as WiiWare project type with ability to compile the final project yourself.
