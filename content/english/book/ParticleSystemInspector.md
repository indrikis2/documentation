The Particle System Inspector (Shuriken)
----------------------------------------

The <span class=menu>Particle System Inspector</span> shows one particle system at a time (the currently selected one), and it looks like this:

Individual particle systems can take on various complex behaviors by using [Modules](ParticleSystemModulesIntro.md).

They can also be extended by being grouped together into <span class=keyword>Particle Effects</span>. 

If you press the button <span class=menu>Open Editor ...</span>, this will open up the Extended <span class=menu>Particle Editor</span>, that shows all of the particle systems under the same root in the scene tree. For more information on particle system grouping, see the section on [Particle Effects](ParticleSystemGrouping.md).
