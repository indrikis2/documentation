Muscle setup
============


Mecanim's concept of "muscles" allows you to have fine control over the character's range of motion. 

Once the Avatar has been [properly configured](ConfiguringtheAvatar), we have a proper bone structure, and we can start working in the <span class=inspector>Muscles</span> tab of the <span class=inspector>Avatar Inspector</span>. Here, it is very easy to tweak the character's range of motion, to make sure the character deforms in a sensible way, and does not have weird artifacts or self-overlaps.

You can either adjust individual bones in the body (lower part of the view), manipulate the character thru predefined deformations, which operate on several bones at once (upper part of the view). 

Muscle Clips
============


In the Animation tab, you can set up animations for muscles and muscle groups (a.k.a. <span class=keyword>Muscle Clips</span>).

You can also control to what body parts these muscle clips apply.
