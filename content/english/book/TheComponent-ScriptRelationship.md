The Component-Script Relationship
=================================


When you create a <span class=keyword>script</span> and and attach it to a GameObject, the script appears in the GameObject's Inspector just like a Component.  This is because scripts become Components when they are saved - a script is just a specific type of Component.  In technical terms, a script compiles as a type of Component, and is treated like any other Component by the Unity engine. So basically, a script is a Component that you are creating yourself.  You will define its members to be exposed in the Inspector, and it will execute whatever functionality you've written.
