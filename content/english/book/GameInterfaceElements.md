Game Interface Elements
=======================


Unity gives you a number of options for creating your game's graphic user interface (GUI).  You can use [GUI Text](class-GuiText.md) and [GUI Texture](class-GuiTexture.md) objects in the scene, or generate the interface from scripts using <span class=keyword>UnityGUI</span>.

The rest of this page contains a detailed guide for getting up and running with UnityGUI.
